What is the **Distributivity** property?
<!--question-->
Distribution refers to two valid rules of replacement. The rules allow one to reformulate conjunctions and disjunctions within logical proofs. E.g.
$$$
3 \times (4 + 5) = (3 \times 4) + (3 \times 5)
$$$

Given a set $S$ and two binary operators $*$ and $+$ on $S$, the operation $*$:

- is left-distributive over + if, given any elements $x$, $y$, and $z$ of $S$,
$$$
x*(y+z)=(x*y)+(x*z),
$$$
- is right-distributive over $+$ if, given any elements $x$, $y$, and $z$ of $S$,

$$$
(y+z)*x=(y*x)+(z*x),
$$$

and is distributive over $+$ if it is left- and right-distributive. When $*$ is commutative, the three conditions above are logically equivalent.
