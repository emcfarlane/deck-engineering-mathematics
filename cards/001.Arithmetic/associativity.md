What is the **Associative** property?
<!--question-->
Rearranging the parentheses in an expression will not change the result.

$$$
3 + (4 + 5) = (3 + 4) + 5 = 3 + 4 + 5
$$$

A binary operation $*$ on a set $S$ is called associative if it satisfies the associative law:

$$$
(x * y) * z = x * (y * z)\qquad {\ \text{for all }}x, y, z \in S.
