What is the **Remainder theorem**?
<!--question-->
The *remainder theorem* states that if the polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $(x-a)$, the quotient will be a polynomial $g(x)$ of one degree less than the degree of $f(x)$, together with a remainder $R$ still to be divided by $(x-a)$.

$$$
\frac{f(x)}{x-a} = g(x) + \frac{R}{x-a} \\
f(x) = (x-a).g(x) + R
$$$

When $x=a$
$$$
f(a) = 0.g(a) + R = R
$$$
