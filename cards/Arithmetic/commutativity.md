What is the **Commutative** property?
<!--question-->
A binary operation is commutative if changing the order of the operands does not change the result.


A binary operation $âˆ—$ on a set $S$ is called commutative if:
$$$
x*y=y*x\qquad {\text{for all }}x,y\in S
$$$
An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called non-commutative.
